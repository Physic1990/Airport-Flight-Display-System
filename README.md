# Airport-Flight-Display-System

This is a Project about Airport Flight Display System that uses React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and a Datastax Astra DB (built on Apache Cassandra) for the database. The REST API is used for communication between the frontend and backend, allowing the user to retrieve flight information from the database and display it in the frontend.
